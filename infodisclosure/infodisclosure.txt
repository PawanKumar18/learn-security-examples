Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The absence of adequate input cleansing for usernames in the insecure script exposes it to possible NoSQL injection threats. For instance, an attacker could introduce a MongoDB query like `username != ''`, or insert some JavaScript code, aiming to extract all passwords or erase all data. To counteract this vulnerability, the script secure.js has been updated to include a process for username sanitization, enhancing the safety with which user inputs are processed and managed.
