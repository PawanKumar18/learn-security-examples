Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The original code has vulnerabilities due to insufficient defenses against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and the risk of session hijacking.

Initially, the problems are:
- Absence of CSRF defense mechanisms, enabling attackers to execute actions as if they were authenticated users without their knowledge.
- The session cookie isn't configured with `httpOnly` and is missing the `SameSite` attribute, exposing it to session hijacking through the execution of client-side scripts.

In the revised version, these issues are addressed as follows:
- The session cookie is set to `httpOnly`, which blocks access from client-side JavaScript, thus reducing the risk of session hijacking.
- The `SameSite` attribute is added to the session cookie to limit its use to first-party contexts only, safeguarding against CSRF.
- The secret key used for session encryption is inputted through a command-line argument, improving the management of session security.

Spoofing attacks threaten the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) principles in the following ways:

Confidentiality: By enabling unauthorized access to confidential information, spoofing attacks breach data confidentiality. An attacker, for example, could masquerade as a legitimate user or system to access restricted data.

Integrity: Spoofing can also endanger data integrity by allowing unapproved modifications. An attacker could pose as a trustworthy entity to transmit harmful data or instructions, potentially leading to unauthorized alterations in data or system configurations.

Spoofing attacks, by mimicking legitimate sources, can trick systems or individuals into releasing sensitive data or permitting unauthorized activities, thereby violating the data and system confidentiality and integrity.
